                <h3>Hi, I'm James Schroeder!</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I'm a senior at the University of Louisville's College of Business. I'm wrapping up an undergraduate degree in Computer Information Systems in both web development and information security. <br>
                <br>
                I'm a big nerd with a big love of technology. When it comes to tech, if you can code it, wear it, or dream it, it's exciting to me! <br>
                <br></p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>I've worked as a business analyst for a Google Glass Partnered  company. I've also done a lot of cool things along the way in my studies, from setting up virtual desktops for our school's computer labs, volunteering at <a href="http://www.codepalousa.com/">CodeAPaLOUSa</a>, and participating in cyber defense league competitions.<br>
                <br>
                    Things I love:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Music! I want to become a producer and create my own studio! You might hear my songs someday in... </li>
                    <li>Video games! They were practically my babysitter growing up.  From classics to the latest releases, I play a lot when I can!</li>
                    <li>Board games! I'm a regular at several of the local game shops and I attend GenCon in Indianapolis every year to play the latest games, anything from deck builders to strategy games!</li>
                </ul>
